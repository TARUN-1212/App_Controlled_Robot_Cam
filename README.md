App-Controlled Robot Car with Live Video Streaming



## App-Controlled Robot Car with Live Video Streaming

This repository contains the code and resources for a robot car project controlled through a mobile application! The robot features a camera that streams live video to the app, allowing users to:

* **Remotely Control the Robot Car:** The app provides controls for navigating the robot car in real-time.
* **See What the Robot Sees:** The live video stream from the robot camera provides a first-person view of the robot's surroundings.

**Features:**

* App-based control for intuitive robot car navigation (developed using MIT App Inventor).
* Live video streaming for real-time visual feedback.
* Open-source design for customization and exploration. 

**Hardware Components**

This project utilizes the following hardware components:

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno
* **Motor Control:** L293D Motor Control Shield
* **Communication:** HC-05 Bluetooth Module
* **Camera:** Mobile Camera (mounted on the robot car)
* **Power:**
    * 18650 Battery Holder (2 Cell)
    * 2x 18650 Battery Cells (3.7V)
    * On/Off Switch
* **Other:** Jumper Wires

**Getting Started**

This repository provides the following resources to get you started building your app-controlled robot car:

* **Android App (APK):** (Optional) If you're distributing the pre-built Android app, include the downloadable APK file.
* **MIT App Inventor Project (Optional):**  If you'd like users to be able to modify the app functionality, consider including the source code from MIT App Inventor (requires additional setup).
* **Robot Car Hardware Schematics:** Learn about the robot car's components and assembly process through schematics and diagrams.
* **Server-Side Code (Optional):**  If a server is involved in video streaming, include relevant code or instructions.

**Building Instructions**

1. **Review the Hardware Schematics:** Familiarize yourself with the components listed above and their connections. (Consider adding a link to the schematics in this section)
2. **Assemble the Robot Car:** Follow the provided schematics and wiring diagrams to assemble the robot car, including the motor control shield, camera mounting, and Bluetooth module connection.
3. **Install the Mobile App (Optional):**  If you're including the pre-built Android app (APK file), provide instructions for installing it on an Android device.
4. **Developing the App with MIT App Inventor (Optional):** If you include the MIT App Inventor source code, provide instructions on how to set up the development environment and modify the app's functionalities. 
5. **Connect the App and Robot Car:**  In the schematics or a separate document, explain how to establish the connection between the mobile app and the robot car via Bluetooth (e.g., pairing instructions).

**Further Exploration**

This project serves as a foundation for further development. You can explore features like:

*  Integrating different communication protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi) for app-robot car connection.
*  Implementing advanced video processing algorithms on the robot or within the app (e.g., object detection, line following).
*  Adding functionalities like obstacle avoidance or path planning based on the live video feed.
*  Enhancing the mobile app interface for improved control and user experience.

**Community**

We welcome contributions and improvements to this open-source project! Feel free to share ideas, bug fixes, or new functionalities through pull requests.
